This lesson introduces tuples. We start by creating a few variables that can be used in the examples to follow. The first example splits a dictionary entry and returns a tuple (two values in this case). We see how to print out each value of the tuple. Next we work with a dictionary to create tuples. The lesson ends with showing how tuples cannot be reassigned.
